        <td>@janit42 Hey just took a quick look, sorry for the wait. In regards to the rubocop issues that you are seeing, %r{} has just been declared a rule for our modules, rather than swapping it in when needed we keep it as the default option as we've found it to be neater overall.
As for the remaining errors, it look's like a disable for the rules in question would be your best choice if you cannot get them to match the rules in a neat fashion, just add the below snippet to your code and it will take care of it:
```
# rubocop:disable Layout/SpaceAfterComma, Metrics/LineLength
[...]
# rubocop:enable Layout/SpaceAfterComma, Metrics/LineLength
```
It's not something that we encourage but we do recognize that it is sometimes necessary.
Anyway I hope that helps :)</td>

        <td>Hi
  Since Facter::Util::Resolution is extended by Core::Execution (https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/facter/Facter/Util/Resolution)  i was sure that this should work the same.

My facter have to be to old for execute **timeout** option to work:
```
# cat  /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/sleep.rb 
require 'facter'
Facter.add(:sleep) do
  setcode do
    begin
      Facter::Core::Execution.execute('sleep 10', options = {:timeout => 5})
      'did not timeout!'
    rescue Facter::Core::Execution::ExecutionFailure
      'timeout!'
    end
  end
end
```

```
# date; facter -p sleep; date
Mon Dec 23 14:49:23 UTC 2019
did not timeout!
Mon Dec 23 14:49:33 UTC 2019
```

```
# facter  -v
2.4.6
# facter  -p os 
{"name"=>"Ubuntu", "family"=>"Debian", "release"=>{"major"=>"16.04", "full"=>"16.04"}, "lsb"=>{"distcodename"=>"xenial", "distid"=>"Ubuntu", "distdescription"=>"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS", "distrelease"=>"16.04", "majdistrelease"=>"16.04"}}
```

I barely know ruby but looking at the gem source: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/facter/Facter/Core/Execution/Base
i can not see how this **timeout** option should work since the command is executeded by statement
```
out = %x{#{expanded_command}}.chomp
```

Thanks for submitting this PR. 
The issue you are having there seems to be caused by the warning you have received. The main problem is the parsing of the iptables output above this [line](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/blob/2a569afd70b82933b971864fcc1e174888ef3d81/lib/puppet/provider/firewall/iptables.rb#L546)

This draft looks really good.

I think for now we should keep the possibility to install either version, for now, so I believe some conditional logic should be added, as you already did, so please go ahead and prepare a couple of tests and we'll give it a try once the PR is ready for review. </td>

Thank you for submitting this PR.

I've added a commit to fix the unit testing for this change, however it appears there are some acceptance testing failures caused by this change that you can verify in travis. 

Can you verify and fix the testing for those failures ? You might be able to run the tests on your local machine with Litmus to have an easier time getting these issues solved. Please let us know if you are having trouble with this.</td>

While it _would_ bandaid the problem, there's a deeper issue - this code should not be evaluating at all and instead relying on the feature confine to ensure the dependency is installed; this is only running because of the way the `commands` provider idiom is implemented.

I have filed #287 with a more thorough fix - would very much appreciate if you could test that in your environment and let me know if it works for you!</td>

        <td>So, there are issues with getting the facts if not set in scope as `$facts`, a) risk of getting server side facts when called on master and b) if there are many "deferred facts" they would all result in running Facter and this would be slow c) since each call will run Facter, the values may differ for the same fact
 
The best would be if the facts were already present in scope when deferred calls are resolved. That requires a change to Puppet however as the setup and use of PAL on the agent side for resolution of Deferred must be given the facts to use. (The rest should already be supported by PAL; i.e. setting `$facts` etc.)

If not computed and set up front, then I think the result needs to be cached and kept while resolving deferred values. This would be good since if there is no call to get a deferred fact then Facter does not need to run at all. If going this route, there is a supported caching mechanism that functions can use. With this there is still the problem of getting the wrong facts (for server when agent was intended) as the place intention is known is when setting up the context (i.e. when setting up PAL for resolution, or when setting up for apply, master compile, bolt apply compile, etc.).</td>

        <td>Hi @justinstoller,

Depending on how much the behaviour changes, it might be a barrier to switching over. I'm not familiar enough with the pson/json differences to be able to make a judgement call on that. I would guess that most users of those functions are actually looking for JSON, not pson semantics, so it might be really not a big deal in this case.

With the changes in #1079 we're moving all non-deprecated functions to `stdlib::` prefix. I haven't worked through all the issues there yet, but see the commit message on https://github.com/DavidS/puppetlabs-stdlib/commit/25a2af2e4fe437a769cdcf1f276489d7ebf36659 for a up-to-date snapshot of where the project is at.

Thanks for opening this PR.

In order to check out a specific revision I recommend you avoid using the depth parameter and just use a reset to your desired revision after cloning the branch you need. Here's an example manifest that does a reset on a commit SHA:

```
vcsrepo { '/test/repo':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => git,
  source   => 'git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo.git',
  revision => 'efea838d92b283fff697a58ebdd723a02e7a0e84',
}
```
